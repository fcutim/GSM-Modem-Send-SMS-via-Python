# How to Setup

Step 1: Plug the module into your device.

Step 2: If present, remove the SIM PIN.

Step 3: Insert the SIM card into the GSM module.

Step 4: Open a browser and install the "Serial Port Driver CH340". You can find it here (https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html). It is important that after downloading the file, you move the EXE file to the desktop so that no problems arise.

Step 5: Open the main.py with the "CMD" already provided by Windows. To do this, enter "CMD" in the address bar of the folder at the top. Then you write: "python main.py". (Important: You MUST have Python installed).
